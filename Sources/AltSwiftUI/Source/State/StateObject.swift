/// StateObject works similarly as ObservedObject, with the only
/// difference that for being part of a view's state, if the view
/// is recreated while owning an object, the object won't be recreated
/// and will keep it's previous data.
///
/// On view recreation (by a state change in its parent):
/// - ObservedObject owned by view: Gets recreated (re-initialized)
/// - StateObject owned by view: Keeps same instance
